# Classes and Objects (OOP CONCEPT)

# Experiment 11 - To study and implement Classes and Objects

## Aim: - 
To run and execute a code using objects and classes in C++

## Theory : -
In C++ (an object-oriented programming language, or OOP), a **class** is a blueprint that defines the properties (data) and behaviors (methods) of objects. 
An **object** is an instance of a class, representing a specific entity that can hold data and interact with other objects using the methods defined in its class.

### Advantages of Classes and Objects in C++:

1. **Encapsulation:** Classes bundle data and methods, hiding internal implementation details and exposing only necessary parts, which promotes modularity and reduces complexity.

2. **Reusability:** Classes can be reused to create multiple objects, reducing code duplication and improving maintainability.

3. **Inheritance:** Classes can inherit properties and methods from other classes, facilitating code reuse and the creation of hierarchical relationships.

4. **Polymorphism:** Allows objects to be treated as instances of their parent class, enabling flexibility in code and the ability to use objects of different classes interchangeably.

5. **Abstraction:** Classes allow you to model complex systems by abstracting real-world entities into objects, making code easier to understand and manage.

### Disadvantages of Classes and Objects in C++:

1. **Overhead:** The abstraction provided by classes can introduce additional memory and performance overhead compared to procedural programming.

2. **Complexity:** Designing a robust class hierarchy can be complex and may lead to difficulties in understanding and maintaining the code.

3. **Inheritance Issues:** Improper use of inheritance can lead to problems like the diamond problem, where ambiguities arise in multiple inheritance scenarios.

4. **Memory Management:** Manual memory management in C++ can lead to issues such as memory leaks or dangling pointers if not handled properly within classes.
